#  Disease Prediction Project
- This is a machine-learning-based system that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms. It cleans raw medical data, analyzes relationships between diseases and symptoms, and trains models for accurate predictions.


## Features
- Symptom Mapping: Matches symptoms to diseases using encoded datasets.
- Data Visualization: Uses graphs to explore symptom-disease relationships.
- Model Training: Trained with Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models for predictions.
- Prediction Accuracy: Provides probabilities for predicted diseases.


## Technologies Used
Programming Language: `Python`
Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy` - Data handling and cleaning
`seaborn`, `matplotlib` - Data visualization
`sklearn` - Machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)
`csv` - Raw data parsing
Visualization Tools: Exported decision trees for insights.
